## Inspiration
It is clear to see that today's world is a fractured one. Even in this day and age where everyone can talk with virtually anyone, any meaningful conversation is rare. Instead, people turn to places like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as outlets for mudslinging and creating conflict, with society in a worse state than before they started. The effects of such a confrontational and close-minded society can be felt and have been for several years. Ever since the 2016 election, the nation has been on a downward spiral, almost to the point where it's nearly impossible to debate without a fight. With our application, we hope to revive what the forefathers valued so much: Civil Discussion.
## Solution
For us, this application is more than just a place people can talk about various topics. We want to fundamentally change the way people approach contentious issues. As firm believers in the idea that positive change only comes from constructive conversation, we have developed a platform that not only allows for telephone-style debates, but also transcribes and analyzes the conversation, creates forum posts, and cultivates a space for meaningful, productive discussion.
#### Process
First, if a user wants to debate, they will sign into their account and search for the topic of their choice. They then can click the call button and wait for someone to match-up with. As they debate, their conversation is transcribed and arguments are analyzed and flagged if they are unsupported by evidence. This way, no blankets statements can be made and the discussion maintains credibility. After the debate is over, everything is uploaded as a forum post that everyone has access to. From there, others can post and contribute to the conversation.
